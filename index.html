                The one-shot coronavirus vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson provides strong protection against severe disease and death from Covid-19, and may reduce the spread of the virus by vaccinated people, according to new analyses posted online by the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday.
                The vaccine had a 72 percent overall efficacy rate in the United States and 64 percent in South Africa, where a highly contagious variant emerged in the fall and is now driving most cases. The efficacy in South Africa was seven percentage points higher than earlier data released by the company.

                    <p>The serious lower leg injuries Tiger Woods sustained in a car crash on Tuesday typically lead to a long and perilous recovery, calling into question his ability to play professional golf again, according to medical experts who have treated similar injuries.</p>
                    <p>Athletes with severe leg injuries thought to doom their careers have managed to come back — the quarterback Alex Smith returned to playing football last season after a gruesome leg break, and the golfer Ben Hogan returned decades ago after a car accident.</p>
                    <p>But Woods’s injuries are more extensive, and his path to recovery is strewn with serious obstacles. Infections, inadequate bone healing and, in Woods’s case, previous injuries and chronic back problems may make a months long or even years long recovery even more difficult, and may reduce the chances that he will play again.</p>
                    <p>In the accident near Los Angeles, Woods’s lower right leg was smashed and his right foot severely injured, and his leg muscles swelled so much that surgeons had to cut open the tissue covering them to relieve pressure, Dr. Anish Mahajan, the chief medical officer at Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center, where Woods, 45, was treated, wrote in a Twitter message posted on Woods’s account.</p>

                    <p>When indoor rinks closed last spring due to COVID-19, sales of ice skates cratered, says Dan Riegelman, owner of Minnesota-based manufacturer Riedell Skates. But as winter approached, a surge of sales across the northern U.S., where skating can be done outside, helped buoy the company.</p>
                    <p>“The sport has just exploded in popularity,” agrees Paxson Woelber, a wild skater in Anchorage, Alaska. Nearby shops sold out of skates in October, he says, supporting a community of people who spend the cold months hunting for the perfect slippery surface.</p>
                    <p>When Woelber is sliding across Alaska’s wild ice, documented in the video below, he doesn’t use figure or hockey skates. He wears Nordic ice skates, which have steel blades fitted with bindings that allow skaters to lift their heels and push off with every stroke.</p>
                    <p>“You have much more stability on rough ice,” explains Ben Prime, owner of the <a href="https://nordicskater.com/">Nordic Skater</a>  shop in Newbury, New Hampshire, adding that the long blades (ranging from 15 to 21 inches) make it easier to cover long distances. Other essential gear includes sharp-tipped poles for balance and extra power, and a throw bag, which holds a rope that can be tossed to a skater who has plunged through the ice. Skaters also carry ice claws, handheld spikes used to climb out of the water.</p>
